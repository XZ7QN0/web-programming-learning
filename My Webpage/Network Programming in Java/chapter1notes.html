            <h1>Chapter 1: Basic Network Concepts</h1>
            <p>
                <span class="definition">Network</span> - A collection of computers and other devices that can send data to
                and receive data from one another in almost real-time.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Often connected by wires (bits of data turned into electromagnetic waves)</li>
                <li>Wireless networks transmit data using radio waves</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span class="definition">Nodes</span> - Any device that can connect to a network</p>
            <p><span class="definition">Host</span> - A node that is a general-purpose computer</p>
            <h3>Layers in Detail</h3>
            <p><span class="definition">Host-to-Network:</span> The parts of networking that is hidden from the developer, which defines how
                a particular network interface (Ethernet cord, WiFi antenna, or any hardware used for networking) sends IP datagrams
                over its physical connection to the local network and the world. Can also be known as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Link layer</li>
                <li>Data link layer</li>
                <li>Network interface layer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Host-to-Network typically concerns a developer when the concern is about performance.</p>
            <p><span class="definition">Internet Layer:</span> Known as the network layer in the
                <abbr title="Open Systems Interconnection">OSI</abbr> model, this layer defines how:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>bits and bytes of data are organized into larger groups called packets, and</li>
                <li>the addressing scheme by which different machines find one another.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The most wifely used network layer protocol (and the only one that Java understands) is the Internet Protocl (IP),
                which is actually two protocols:</p>
            <p>IPv4</p>
            <ul>
                <li>32-bit addresses</li>
                <li>Accounts for >90% of Internet traffic</li>
                <li>Little over 4 billion possible IP addresses</li>
                <li>Datagram header is 20-60 bytes long</li>
                <li>Payload that contains up to 65,515 bytes of data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>IPv6</p>
            <ul>
                <li>128-bit addresses & additional routing features</li>
                <li>Catching on fast</li>
                <li>Datagram contains larger header</li>
                <li>Up to 4GB of data</li>
                <li>Will be enough IP address for everyone</li>
                <li>Written in 8 blocks of 4 hexadecimal digits separated by colons</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span class="definition">Transport Layer:</span> The layer responsible for ensuring that packets are received in the order they were sent and
                that no data is lost or corrupted. If packets get lost or corrupted, the transport layer asks the sender to retransmit the packet.
                IP networks implement this by adding an additional header to each datagram that contains more information.
                There are two primary protocols at this level:</p>
            <ul><abbr title="Transmission Control Protocol">TCP (Reliable Protocol)</abbr>
                <li>High-overhead protocol that allows for retransmission of lost or corrupted data and delivery
                    of bytes in the order they were sent</li>
                <br><abbr title="User Datagram Protocol">UDP (Unreliable Protocol)</abbr>
                <li>Allows the receiver to detect corrupted packets but does not guarantee that
                    packets are delivered in the correct order (or at all)</li>
                <li>Is often faster than TCP</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span class="definition">Application Layer:</span> The layer that delivers data to the user.
                The three lower layers (Transport layer, Internet layer, and Host-to-Network layer) work together
                to define how data is transferred from one computer to another. It decides what to do
                with the data after it's transferred. Typically, data will be presented to a user in a
                form that they understand, rather than a long stream of numbers. The application layer
                is where most of the network parts of our programs will spend their time.</p>
            <p>Some application layer protocols include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> (Web)</li>
                <li>SMTP, POP, and IMAP (Email)</li>
                <li>FTP, FSP, and TFTP (File Transfer)</li>
                <li>NFS (File access)</li>
                <li>Gnutella & BitTorrent (File sharing)</li>
                <li><abbr title="Session Initiation Protocol">SIP</abbr> & Skype (Voice communication)</li>
                <li>& more</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Protocols in Detail</h3>
            <ul><abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr>
                <li>Developed with military sponsorship during Cold War</li>
                <li>Robust</li>
                <li>Designed to allow multiple routes between any two points and to route packets of data around damaged routers</li>
                <li>Open & platform-independent</li>
                <li>Packets may not arrive in the order they were sent, or even arrive at all</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>TCP
                <li>Layered on top of IP to give each end of connection the ability to acknowledge receipt of IP packets and
                    request retransmission of lost or corrupted packets</li>
                <li>Allows packets to be reorganized on receiving end in the same order packets were sent</li>
                <li>Carries a good amount of overhead</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>UDP
                <li>Chosen over TCP if order of data sent does not matter, and loss of individual packets won't corrupt data stream</li>
                <li>Acceptable for applications where some data loss is not noticed by end user
                    (ex: losing a few bits from video or audio signal)</li>
                <li>Error-correcting codes can be built into UDP data streams at the application level for any missing data</li>
            </ul>
            <ul><abbr title="Internet Control Message Protocol">ICMP</abbr>
                <li>Another protocol that can run on top of IP</li>
                <li>Uses raw IP datagrams to relay error messages between hosts</li>
                <li>Used in ping</li>
                <li>Java doesn't support ICMP, nor allow sending of raw IP datagrams
                    (Only supports TCP and UDP protocols, and application layer protocols built on top of these)</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>The following layers and protocols can only be implemented in Java programs by linking to native code:
                <li>Transport layer</li>
                <li>Internet layer</li>
                <li>Lower layer protocols, such as
                    <ul>
                        <li>ICMP</li>
                        <li>IGMP</li>
                        <li>ARP</li>
                        <li>RARP</li>
                        <li>RSVP</li>
                        <li>Others</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
